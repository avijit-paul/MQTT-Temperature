Use the BME280 sensor to accomplish the following:
1. Sense the temperature in Celcius every 5 seconds and publish it retained as a float (4 Bytes)
on the MQTT topic mqtt/temp.
 The MQTT broker has the IP address 192.168.*.*
 Use the SSID xxxxxxx and the WPA2 key xxxxxxx to connect your ESP to the
WiFi-network.
 To convert from float to char[] you should use memcpy.
 If you are interested, you can watch whatâ€˜s happening on MQTT using mosquitto_sub or
MQTTfx.
